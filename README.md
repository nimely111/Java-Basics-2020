# Java-Basics-2020

<!--
    Two overlapping circles representing:

Growth and expansion
The connection between technology and humanitarian work
The letter 'J' subtly incorporated into the design


Color scheme:

Deep blue (#2B5BA9) for trustworthiness and professionalism
Lighter blue (#4A90E2) for innovation and forward-thinking
White accents for clarity and simplicity


Typography:

Bold, clean font for "JESTIN" to ensure visibility
Smaller, elegant text for "CORPORATION"
Professional spacing and alignment



The logo is designed to work well both in digital and print formats, and can be easily scaled without losing quality since it's an SVG.
